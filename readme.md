# Healthcare Claims Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes a simulated dataset of healthcare claims to uncover trends in **revenue**, **payment speed**, and **denial rates** by payer and provider.  
The dashboard provides actionable insights for identifying top-performing payers, bottlenecks in payment processing, and areas with high denial rates.
